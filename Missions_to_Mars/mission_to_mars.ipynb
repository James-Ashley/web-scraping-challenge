    "\n",
    "Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NASA Mars News\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "news_title = \"NASA's Next Mars Mission to Investigate Interior of Red Planet\"\n",
    "\n",
    "news_p = \"Preparation of NASA's next spacecraft to Mars, InSight, has ramped up this summer, on course for launch next May from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California -- the first interplanetary launch in history from America's West Coast.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "* Make sure to save a complete url string for this image.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Mars Hemispheres\n",

    "* Visit the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image url to the full resolution image.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save both the image url string for the full resolution hemisphere image, and the Hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys `img_url` and `title`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Append the dictionary with the image url string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.\n",

    "    {\"title\": \"Cerberus Hemisphere\", \"img_url\": \"...\"},\n",

    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.\n",
